excerpt: "A few thoughts about static CMS"

I've spend a few hours playing with this blog and jekyll itself. It's pretty cool.
I really like the flexibility of the system, and the fact you can pretty much throw any markup to it...
I have pages like this in Markdown, other pages in HTML, and I'm just discovering.

It's also my first time playing with SASS. I've used LESS in the past, when developing custom templates & themes for CKAN.
To be fair I can't see much difference between the two, both work pretty well and do what you expect; functions, variables etc.

Jekyll is really a useful tool if you know what you want, because you'll have the freedom to do whatever you want.
The drawback is that you have to do a lot more that you have to with a CMS such as Drupal or Wordpress...
Mostly because you don't rely on a database to do search & faceting.

But the fun is there for sure.
I'll be posting soon about Docker & CKAN containers.
